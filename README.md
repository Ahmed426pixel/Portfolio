# Portfolio
This Python application is a Stock Portfolio Tracker built with Tkinter for the graphical user interface, Matplotlib for charting, and the Financial Modeling Prep API for fetching stock data.

Features:
Add/Remove Stocks: Users can add stocks to their portfolio, specifying the symbol and quantity. Stocks can also be removed or cleared entirely.
View Portfolio: The portfolio displays detailed information about each stock, including symbol, company name, quantity, current price, total value, market cap, and P/E ratio.
Stock Details: Users can view detailed historical performance of individual stocks in a separate window.
Charts: The application generates and displays a pie chart of portfolio distribution and a performance chart showing stock trends over time.
Save/Load Portfolio: Users can save their portfolio to a JSON file and load it back later. They can also export their portfolio to a CSV file and import from a CSV file.
Text-to-Speech: Added stock information is announced using a text-to-speech engine.
The application provides an intuitive interface for managing stock investments and visualizing portfolio performance.
